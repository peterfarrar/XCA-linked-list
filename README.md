# lXA-linked-list
A linked list example for the XCA  
Hmm... this was supposed to be called XCA-linked-list.  Oh well.

This is a simple example, there's no type checking/data integrity.  Just a very basic single linked list.  

### App.js
The app.js file is empty.  Feel free to add code and play.  

### Test
The test directory has a basic chai set up for mocha, and a couple of files with really simple unit tests.  These are probably a good first look at unit testing with Mocha.

### Package.js and NPM
There's only one command in the package.js file. `npm run test` or `npm t` will run the unit tests.
